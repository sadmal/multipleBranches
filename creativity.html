    <h2>What is Creativity?</h2>
    <p>* Creativity is the ability to think about a task or a problem in a new or different way, or the ability to use the imagination to generate new ideas. Creativity enables you to solve complex problems or find interesting ways to approach tasks. If you are creative, you look at things from a unique perspective.</p>

        <h2>10 ways to improve creativity skills</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>1. Try the circle challenge</h3>
            Draw twenty circles then set a stopwatch for 30 seconds. Make each circle into a unique picture before the timer ends. This exercise forces you to think about the same thing in different ways. Repeat it periodically to see how your thoughts change over time.<br>
            
            <h3>2. Use a sketchpad</h3>
            As well as exercising creativity, drawing or writing down ideas can help you process information. If you are listening to a presentation, you could sketch something relevant to what you are hearing. This can help you remember the things being said.<br>
            
            
            <h3>3. Read regularly</h3>
            Reading is just one way to mentally exercise. Exploring fiction novels, for example, can introduce you to interesting creative concepts such as complex worlds, storylines, puzzles and characters. Another easy way to practice mentally challenging games and puzzles is by using an app on your phone or another mobile device.<br>
            
            <h3>4. Write</h3>
            Try recording your thoughts in a journal at the end of each day. Writing encourages you to think critically about your daily experiences and ideas. Finding ways to apply critical and analytical thinking is a great way to exercise your mental abilities.<br>
            
            <h3>5. Exercise</h3>
            Taking care of your physical and mental health can help put you in an optimal position to practice and apply creative thinking. Adding regular exercise, if even for 20-30 minutes two to three times per week, is one way to be your best self at work.<br>
            
            <h3>6. Take a new route</h3>
            Challenge yourself to take an alternative path to a place you regularly go to experience new surroundings. Going a different way will expose you to unfamiliar sights, sounds, and experiences, which all aid in improving your overall creativity.<br>
            
            <h3>7. Try something new</h3>
            Maybe it's a new food, outfit or a movie, but trying something new stimulates your brain to make connections and see things a different way. When you expose yourself to new things, you naturally improve your ability to think creatively by remaining open-minded and observant.<br>
            
            <h3>8. Listen to music</h3>
            Music can move you on an emotional level and change your mood and focus. When you need to think creatively or brainstorm, find music that is inspiring. Even if you're in an open office concept, putting in your earbuds to a creativity-enhancing track can vastly improve your problem-solving and innovation skills.<br>
            
            
            <h3>9. Ask for feedback about your ideas</h3>
            Creativity is not inclusive to your thoughts and ideas but also integrates people's concepts and collaboration with others. One way to improve your creative thinking is to ask for feedback or advice about your ideas. When receiving the input, try to put yourself in your colleague's place to understand their point of view.<br>
            
             <h3>10.Find motivation in an unrelated industry</h3>
            When problem-solving about a challenge related to your field, look outside your industry for motivation. There may be a simple answer or idea available that would work for your scenario. Using the skills of making connections, observation, and problem-solving, you can draw on others' successes to achieve your own.</p>
