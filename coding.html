    <h1>Coding/Programming Skills</h1>
    <p>* Coding skills, also known as programming skills, refer to the art of using various programming languages to write commands, instructing a computer, application, or software program about the actions it must perform and how. Coding skills make it possible to create various computer software, games, apps, websites and much more.

        Coding skills, also known as programming skills, are the knowledge and understanding of languages, frameworks, and architecture that enables a coder to create any digital product. In a digitally-connected world, coding skills influence nearly all aspects of human life. Hence, possessing programming skills is crucial for success in any domain. Programmers write codes to create innovative digital products using their exceptional coding/programming skills combined with analytical and creative thinking skills.</p>

        <h1>What Is Computer Code Used For?</h1>
        <p>Coding is used for communicating with computers. People use coding to give computers and other machines instructions on what actions to perform. We also use computer code to program the websites, apps, and other technologies we interact with every day. It might sound simple, but how does coding work?</p>
        <br>
        <h1>How Does Coding Work?</h1>
        <p>Coding works by creating instructions in a language that computers can understand and implement. Computers are electronic machines made with transistors, which are simple solid-state, on-and-off switches. For the sake of brevity, when you combine tens of thousands of these on/off switches, you get a computer.<br>

            This is how coding works in basic terms: binary code (also known as 1s and 0s) instructs these switches whether to turn on (1) or turn off (0). Each transistor will receive a 1 or a 0, and with thousands working at once, a computer can perform a multitude of actions.<br>
            
            Unfortunately, attempting to make an entire computer work by manually typing a number for each transistor would take an incredible amount of time. So, engineers developed high-level languages to help speed up the process. Rather than addressing individual transistors with machine code, we address entire sections of them to perform a specific task.</p>
